Platform Displays
=================

Overview
--------
This project is ablout using a 0.42 Inch OLED Display LCD Screen Module SSD1306 72x40 as platform displays/indicators for a oo gauge railway model. 
The displays will be fitted under the station canopy, utilising the flexible ribbon cable on the display to mount the circuit board in the cavity of the camopy with the display protruding down at 90 degrees

*Step 1*

This is still at the investigation stage, we might decide that the display size or aspect ratio doesn't work with the model station, so our first step will be to design an enclosure for the display and circuit board, which we can use to visualise if this project is worthwhile pursuing.
